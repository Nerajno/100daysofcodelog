## Final Thoughts
---
I needed to be more confident in myself as it pertained to the job hunt. I also need to block off time to code and work on my discipline.

## Day 0
### Day 0: Sept 30, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** Product Landing Page => [GitHub Page Version](https://nerajno.github.io/fCC_Product_Landing_Page/) In Progress

+ **Progress:** Editted the GitHub repo for my code log.
+ **Progress:** Started to log my process, need to plan more before I code else ... Rabbit hole here I come.
+ **Progress:** Editted a thing that I wrote during bootcamp => [Sight beyond Sight... How Blind Software Engineers Make It Work](https://dev.to/nerajno/sight-beyond-sight-how-blind-software-engineers-make-it-work-4lo0)

**Thougths:** This has been the first time since bootcamp ended that I seriously took up programming seriously again. There is a lot to be said and knowing me, I will write it all down when I manage to get it all presentable... thus in a week or two.
